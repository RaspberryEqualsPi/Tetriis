important things:
Rewarding of Back to Back chains. (Tetris / T-spin)Recognition method depends on the game.
Recognition and rewarding of T-spin moves. Conditions vary between guideline versions.

The player tops out when a piece is spawned overlapping at least one block (block out), or a piece locks completely above the visible portion of the playfield (lock out).

Player may only level up by clearing lines or performing T-Spins. Required lines depends on the game.
May use fixed-goal or variable-goal. (variable-goal is better)
Fixed goal is 10 lines
Variable goal is 5 times the level number.
The line values for variable-goal levels are as follows:
Single = 1 line
Double = 3 lines
Triple = 5 lines
Tetris = 8 lines

Must have sound effects on by default, on rotation, movement, landing on surface, touching a wall, locking, line clear and game over.
